<font size="5"><p>Hi and welcome to Food Grove! We are dedicated to help people getting food who are homeless or who can't afford to get food. We help you connect with your local restaurants, doughnut shops, and bakeries near you so you can help homeless people get food and the resources to survive on and off the streets. When you join us, we let high school students get community service hours for working with us, after doing service hours</p></font>

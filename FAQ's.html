<font size="5"><p>• Does Food Grove pick up from our location? We have a variety of options for pick up. Some of our members in Food Grove will come pick up food from your location. We have associates in the community who also assist in food pick up. </p></font>
<font size="5"><p>• Are containers provided? At this time, we do not have the resources to provide food containers. Most restaurants, bakeries and other providers will often place their food in large to go containers and/or bags. We are not particular as to how the food is delivered as long as it makes the donations portable for our crew who will pick up food items.</p></font>
<font size="5"><p>• Is there a schedule? We create our schedules based on our donors request. You provide the best days and times for pick up and we will work with our crew to assign someone to be there at the agreed upon time range.</p></font>
<font size="5"><p>• Food Safety/Handling? Our staff and volunteers follow all state and local guidelines for proper food handling </p></font>
<font size="5"><p>• Policies and Laws about food donations? Food Grove follows the USDA recommended food donation policies as presented in the Donation of Food in Child Nutrition Programs in the State of California.</p></font>
